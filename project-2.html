1.Bootstrap Basic &amp; Advanced
What exactly is Bootstrap?
Some call it a framework, others a library. Bootstrap describes itself (on its homepage) as "frontend toolkit". However, 
specifying the exact type name is not that important.

The important thing is that Bootstrap allows us to create responsive websites and web applications faster and easier. It 
contains an impressive collection of components (like forms, buttons, navigation bars, etc.) and a powerful grid system 
(allowing to create responsive-mobile-first layouts) that we can use to create user interfaces. It's built with HTML, CSS 
and JavaScript.

Bootstrap was created in 2010 by Twitter developers and released under an open-source license. Since then, it has undergone 
many changes and improvements, and for over a decade it has been the most popular front-end framework in the world (taking 
into account the number of downloads, the number of stars on GitHub or the number of webistes that use it).

For many years it held the honorable title of the most popular project on GitHub (not only among front-end tools, but in 
general among all projects that existed on GitHub).
